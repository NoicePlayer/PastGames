# PastGames
A collection of games I created for fun or for school projects that are various stages of broken.

# Games
### 3D Minesweeper
Basically what it says on the tin; Minesweeper but in 3D, made with Unity. Not very practical, but I learned a lot.

### 2049
My version of 2048, made with pure java goodness. Includes the ability to choose board dimensions and the target tile, complete with ***balanced*** points multipliers. (C to restart, M for menu)

### Kingdom Conqueror
My attempt at creating a peer-to-peer online game, using only AutoHotkey. It works in specific scenarios, but I haven't had a lot of requests to go back and fix it.
It's based off of a card game my friend made IRL.

### Shooty Platformer Thing
This one actually works as designed, its just wasn't designed very well. Shoot the prisms to gain coin, spend coin for upgrades, repeat until death.

### Tronn't
I'm actually proud of this one. The title is  sort of a play on Tron, but 'not'.
The included shortcut is the best way to run the game with no setup.
There are three game modes, 
* Normal which plays like the game Lightcycles.
* Gobble which plays like slither.io
* Domination in which whoever's snake creates the greatest area wins.

Player 1 is controlled with WASD and Q/E for speed up/down
Player 2 is controlled with Arrow Keys and PgUp/Dn

If powerups are enabled in settings, they will randomly spawn during play.
It can technically keep track of the W/L record, but for some reason the hyphen got messed up for displaying it after each match.
