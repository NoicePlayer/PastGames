# PastGames
A collection of games I created for fun or for school projects that are various stages of broken.

# Games
### 3D Minesweeper
Basically what it says on the tin; Minesweeper but in 3D, made with Unity. Not very practical, but I learned a lot.

### 2049
My version of 2048, made with pure java goodness. Includes the ability to choose board dimensions and the target tile, complete with ***balanced*** points multipliers. (C to restart, M for menu)

### Kingdom Conqueror
My attempt at creating a peer-to-peer online game, using only AutoHotkey. It works in specific scenarios, but I haven't had a lot of requests to go back and fix it.

### Shooty Platformer Thing
This one actually works as designed, its just wasn't designed very well. Shoot the prisms to gain coin, spend coin for upgrades, repeat until death.
